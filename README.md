Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Management UI


 Overview

This project is a user-friendly Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) management interface designed to manage users, roles, and permissions effectively. Administrators can:

•	Add, edit, and delete users.
•	Assign roles and statuses to users.
•	Create and modify roles with associated permissions.
This frontend project is built using React, TailwindCSS, and a mock backend served via json-server.

Features
Features
1. Login Page
•	Users and admins can log in with their credentials.
•	Login functionality validates users based on their email and password.
•	Admins are redirected to the Admin Dashboard, while regular users can access the Registration Page.

2. Registration Page
•	New users can create an account.
•	The registration form includes fields for name, email, password, status (active/inactive), and a default role (User).

Admin Credentials
Use the following admin credentials to log in and access the Admin Dashboard:

Email: admin@example.com
Password: admin123

4. Mock API Integration
•	All operations are performed with a mock backend powered by json-server.
•	Includes mock API endpoints for users and roles (/users and /roles).



Technologies Used
•	React: Component-based architecture for dynamic UI rendering.
•	TailwindCSS: Utility-first CSS framework for fast and responsive design.
•	json-server: Mock backend to simulate API calls.
•	Axios: For making API requests to the mock server.
•	React Router: For navigating between the User Management and Role Management pages.

Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/adarsh291201/rbac1.git
cd ui
2. Install Dependencies
npm install
3. Add Mock Data
Create a file named db.json in the root directory with the following content:
{
  "users": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "adarsh raj", "email": "adarsh@gmail.com", "role": "Admin", "status": "Active" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Rnnk ", "email": "rnnk@example.com", "role": "Editor", "status": "Inactive" }
  ],
  "roles": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Admin", "permissions": ["Read", "Write", "Delete"] },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Editor", "permissions": ["Read", "Write"] }
  ]
}
4. Start the Mock Server
json-server --watch db.json --port 5000
The mock server will be available at http://localhost:5000.
5. Start the Development Server
npm start
The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.
